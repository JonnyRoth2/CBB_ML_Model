# College Basketball Machine Learning Model for CMSC320
The jupyter file when ran and used correctly accurately predicts the outcome of basketball games with around a 80% accuracy and predicts the spread at around a 51-52% accuracy with data exploration and finding the most important data points in winning or losing games.
**How to go about reading this repo**
1. The Jupyter Notebook gives detailed statistical findings of the data through statistical tests over the data as well as analysis of different variations of machine learning models. If you want a thourough understanding of how the model works god through the Notebook and read the analysis.
2. If you want to just quickly run this using the predictor the models folder holds base python files slightly modified from the notebook code.
3. The rest including the site files is something im still working on mainly the front end and a flask backend connector for aspects of making this a minimum viable product for a predictor of college basketball that everyday users can use. This part is currently deployed at https://cbb-ml-model-1.onrender.com/ and is on free servers at render so it may be slow but it still works as intended and gives you very accurate predictions on the outcome of basketball games. This will need to be re-ran early into the season maybe after 3-5 games to be accurate since most teams are completely new every year so be weary of early season predictions using the model you cant really ever predict how good a team will be right off the bat even with all the math in the world.
