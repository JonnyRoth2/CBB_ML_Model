# College Basketball Machine Learning Model for CMSC320
The jupyter file when ran and used correctly accurately predicts the outcome of basketball games with around a 80% accuracy and predicts the spread at around a 51-52% accuracy with data exploration and finding the most important data points in winning or losing games.
**How to go about reading this repo**
1. The Jupyter Notebook gives detailed statistical findings of the data through statistical tests over the data as well as analysis of different variations of machine learning models. If you want a thourough understanding of how the model works god through the Notebook and read the analysis.
2. If you want to just quickly run this using the predictor the models folder holds base python files slightly modified from the notebook code.
3. The rest including the site files is something im still working on mainly the front end and a flask backend connector for aspects of making this a minimum viable product for a predictor of college basketball that everyday users can use.
